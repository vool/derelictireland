## #derelictireland

In 2020 I create a site that attempted to gamify the #FreeTheCycleLanes campaign on Twitter, you can read more about that here [vool.ie/portfolio/cycle-space-invaders/](https://vool.ie/portfolio/cycle-space-invaders/)

A year or so later I was asked if I could do something similar for the #DerelictIreland campaign, so I forked [Cycle Space Invaders](https://github.com/vool/cyclespaceinvaders) to make a microsite that catalogues all the #DerelictIreland photos and videos.


Then a strange rich man bought Twitter and shut down access to the API so this no longer works, but you can check out a static copy as it was on 21/11/2025 here 👇
